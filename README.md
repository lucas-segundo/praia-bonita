# Welcome to Praia Bonita

This project is a collaborative development initiative that aims to create a website that presents some well-known beaches of the Brazilian coast. The goal of this project is to practice collaborative development, thus having the experience of how multiple developers work on the same code.

## Project Structure

* Pages, such as ```index.html```, should be in the root of the project to facilitate routing through links.
* The ```styles/``` folder will contain the ```.css``` files to include the styles of the pages.
* The ```.prettierrc.json``` file contains the code formatting rules.
* The ```.vscode/``` folder contains formatting settings following the rules of the ```.prettierrc.json``` file. It is suggested to use vscode.

## Workflow

1. Make a fork of the project to copy the repository to your Github. Remember that the main branch of your fork will be the location where you will make the pull request to the project.
2. Before starting work, check if there are updates to the main branch of this repository. Through the Github interface, it is easier to verify if your fork needs to be updated.
3. After finishing a task, make a pull request to this repository that will start the code review process.

## Code Review

Each pull request will go through a code review, which may be approved or not. If approved, it will enter the production code and will be automatically deployed to the server. If not, the developer must check the Pull requests tab of this repository for the pending issues to be resolved. Note that the changes made to the main branch of your fork will be included in the pull request during the approval process.

## Task Division

* Issues: Each task will be represented by an issue. When finished, write in the title of your pull request a close #ISSUE_NUMBER that Github will automatically close the issue, if it is accepted by the code review. Example: ```feat: form for contact page (close #3)```.

* Projects: Issues will be organized in a project, where tasks will be delegated to each developer, in the style of trello.
